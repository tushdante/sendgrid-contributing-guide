# SendGrid Contributing Guide

Hello! Thank you for choosing to help contribute to the SendGrid official SDKs. There are many ways you can help out with the projects and your help is always welcome. 

### Reporting issues & Feature Requests

The GitHub issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, change requests and submitting pull requests. To help us out we just ask that you do the following:

- Please **search for existing issues** in order to ensure we don't have duplicate bugs/feature requests.
- Please **don't** use the issue tracker for SendGrid account or support issues. Feel free to [email SendGrid Support](mailto:support@sendgrid.com) instead.

#### Commenting on issues 

We ask that you please have empathy with commenting on issues. We have users of all skill levels and backgrounds, so respect, patience, and consideration go a long way to helping each other solve problems.

### Bug Report

A software bug is a demonstrable issue in the code base. In order for us to be able to diagnose the issue and respond as quickly as possible, please add as much detail as you can into your bug report. 

Before you decide to create a new issue, plese try the following:

1. Check the Github issues tab if your issue has already been reported
2. Check if issue has already been fixed
3. Include any steps to reproduce the issue
4. Add any relevant details such as Client version, dependency versions, etc.
5. Include a screencast if necessary

In order to make the process easier, we've included a sample bug report template (borrowed from [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/))

```
